  "name": "Stone-Hand Otter",
  "description": "Clam collector from The Otter Kingdom’s own enchanted forest. Created by OtterClam’s in-house artist and designer, Apppo.  \n  \nThe Stone-Hand Otter must have a family to feed, because he’s got more CLAMs in his basket than he could possibly eat! His smile might be as warm and enchanting as the forest he calls home, but good luck getting that basket of CLAMs out of his stone cold hands!",
