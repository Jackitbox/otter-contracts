  "description": "Quiet, focused Otter resting on a meditation mat sipping tea after a busy day learning how to collect CLAMs. Created by OtterClam’s in-house artist and designer, Apppo.  \n  \nThe Safe-Hand Otter is a simple Otter who wants more but needs little. The Safe-Hand Otter’s CLAMs are safe, but he is extremely careful not to collect more than he can manage to carry safely home.",
